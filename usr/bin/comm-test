Partially worked, now on split the terminal respect size of split, but can't show 2 terminal in same window, on select one split show terminal for this part and hide to another part, if the 2 parts have terminal, need show same

Another problem, now on close split only remove part of terminal and file manager, but continue with blank space on all part usef for this file manager and terminal
